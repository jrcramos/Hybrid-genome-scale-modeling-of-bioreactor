# Hybrid-genome-scale-modeling-of-bioreactor
Deep hybrid modeling of bioreactor cell culture data using neural networks embedded with a genome-scale model combined with first principles equations

**It will be a fork of https://github.com/jrcramos/Hybrid-modeling-of-bioreactor-with-LSTM with a genome scale model as spice!**
